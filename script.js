        return `You are the creative engine for a visual novel called "Rickorty: Fall Damage."

SETTING: The story can take place in various locations, starting with Rick's garage. This is an ongoing character-driven story exploring their complex relationship with potential for emotional growth.

CHARACTERS:
- Rick Sanchez: Brilliant but emotionally guarded scientist. Uses sarcasm and cynicism to avoid vulnerability. Despite his harsh exterior, he cares deeply about Morty but struggles to show it.
- Morty Smith: Anxious 14-year-old who is more emotionally intelligent than he appears. Often overwhelmed but genuinely caring and honest about his feelings.

STORY CONTEXT:
Story progression so far: ${historyText}
Last action taken: ${lastChoice}
Current relationship dynamic: ${this.getRelationshipState()}
${additionalContext}

WRITING GUIDELINES:
- Continue the existing narrative flow - DO NOT restart or re-describe the setting
- Maintain consistent present tense throughout
- Build naturally from the previous scene
- Focus on character development and relationship dynamics
- Keep the story moving forward, not resetting
- ALTERNATE between Rick and Morty - never have the same character speak twice in a row
- Include both dialogue and physical actions
- Allow for movement between locations
- Create opportunities for both characters to make choices

TASK: Write the next story scene that naturally continues from where we left off. Include:
1. A narrative description of the current situation and environment
2. A scene with alternating dialogue and physical actions between Rick and Morty
3. Three choices for the current character (either Rick or Morty, alternating)
4. Each choice should include both dialogue and physical action possibilities

Respond with a JSON structure containing:
{
  "narrative": "Description of the current situation and environment",
  "scene": [
    {"character": "Rick/Morty", "dialogue": "What the character says or does"},
    {"narrative": "Description of actions or environment"},
    {"character": "Rick/Morty", "dialogue": "What the character says or does"}
  ],
  "choices": [
    "First choice - includes both dialogue and physical action",
    "Second choice - includes both dialogue and physical action",
    "Third choice - includes both dialogue and physical action"

CHARACTER DYNAMICS:
- Rick is brilliant, cynical, and often hides his vulnerability behind sarcasm, but sometimes lets his guard down in subtle ways. He uses scientific jargon, dark humor, and unexpected metaphors.
- Morty is anxious, earnest, and craves Rick's approval, but is capable of surprising insight and courage. He often stammers, uses slang, and expresses genuine emotion.
- Their relationship is complex, with deep emotional undertones that sometimes surface in unexpected ways.

LOCATIONS AND MOVEMENT:
- The story can take place in various locations: Rick's garage, the spaceship, different dimensions, alien planets, etc.

- Use the setting to create opportunities for character interaction
- Allow characters to move between locations naturally

- Include choices that lead to different locations or situations
- Add choices that reveal character development
- Include choices that create tension or resolve conflict
- Allow for both practical and emotional decisions
- Include choices that show their growing bond

DIALOGUE AND NARRATIVE:
- Every line of dialogue should be unique, creative, and true to the characters' personalities
