Project Brief: Rickorty: Fall Damage (Chutes-Integrated Visual Novel)

Overview:
Build a playable, browser-based visual novel using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The game runs entirely client-side and integrates with a Chutes-hosted LLM (such as Qwen or DeepSeek) to dynamically generate dialogue and choices based on player input.

Title:
Rickorty: Fall Damage

Characters:
- Rick Sanchez – Sarcastic, emotionally guarded, highly intelligent
- Morty Smith – Anxious, emotionally intuitive, reactive

Style & Tone:
- Slow-burn romance with emotional tension, sarcasm, and branching dialogue
- The story is player-driven with multiple paths and outcomes
- Dialogue is generated in-character using the LLM

Story Setup:
- Opening scene: Rick and Morty are alone in the garage after a failed mission.
- Morty is shaken; Rick deflects with sarcasm.
- The player chooses how Morty responds, setting the tone for their relationship arc.

Core Features:
- Fully browser-based (no installs)
- Responsive UI, mobile-friendly
- Uses Chutes AI LLM to generate:
  - Dialogue segments
  - 2–3 player choices per scene
- Relationship tracker (affection/tension) that influences the tone of replies
- Multiple endings: romantic, platonic, bittersweet
- Restart button to reset and replay the story
- Clean, simple UI:
  - Black background
  - White text box for dialogue
  - Buttons for choices

Avatar Feature:
- Each line of dialogue includes an inline avatar image next to the speaker’s text
- One avatar for Rick, one for Morty
- The user will provide the avatar images
- Avatar should appear beside the corresponding text (not above or detached)

How It Works:
1. Scene loads showing the current story segment from the LLM
2. Player selects one of 2–3 options
3. Frontend sends to Chutes API:
   - Story history
   - Last selected choice
   - Current relationship state
4. Chutes AI LLM responds with:
   - The next scene (dialogue)
   - New choices
5. Loop continues until the story reaches an ending
